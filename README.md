# CS300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

During this course, I worked on solving problems related to data organization, memory efficiency, and runtime performance using core data structures. The primary goal was to evaluate the performance of different structures, such as vectors, binary search trees, and hash tables, and then implement working code that could load, organize, and sort computer science course data in alphanumerical order.

How did you approach the problem? 

To approach this, I began by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure. Vectors offered simplicity and easy traversal, but lacked efficiency in large-scale insertions or searches. Hash tables provided rapid lookups but did not maintain order, while binary search trees offered a balanced trade-off between sorted output and performance.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Along the way, I encountered roadblocks such as handling file input inconsistencies and duplicate entries in course data. To overcome these issues, I implemented better data validation and adjusted insertion logic to filter duplicates, ensuring a clean and consistent dataset for sorting.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project expanded my understanding of how to apply theoretical knowledge of data structures to real-world problems. It reinforced the importance of choosing the right structure for a task, not just from a technical standpoint, but in terms of maintainability and scalability.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This experience has helped me write cleaner and more modular code. I now pay more attention to writing functions that are readable, reusable, and adaptable, which will be valuable as I take on larger and more complex software projects.
